    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The first time I made these easy cinnamon rolls, I made a mess and they STILL turned out! They are gone in 2 days at my house. Simple to make and super yummy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h5>Original recipe yields 20 servings</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
        <li>⅔ cup brown sugar </li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed </li>
        <li>⅓ cup heavy whipping cream </li>
        <li>⅔ cup sifted confectioners' sugar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk </li>
        <li>1 dash vanilla extract </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly grease 2 round cake pans with butter.</li>
        <li>Roll bread dough out to an 6x18-inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter. Combine brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over butter. Roll dough into a log, starting at the long edge. Moisten edge with water and seal. Cut log into 20 slices; arrange rolls, cut sides down, in prepared cake pans. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour heavy cream over dough.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a small bowl; drizzle over warm cinnamon rolls to serve.</li>
    </ol>
